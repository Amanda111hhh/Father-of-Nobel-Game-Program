<h2 align="left">Having a sense of AlphaFold2, we continue to dig deeper for relationships among game, AI and the success of Hassabis... With professional guidance, we head to the father of both game and AI, which is programming. :-O</h2>

 <h1>Hassabis used program to tell us how we can see this world, and there can be many possibilities around us. The thing we need do is embracing program, thinking big and TAKING ACTION!</h1>

                <p>To achieve this dream and make the AI biochemistry professor come true, AlphaFold2, the technology that can predict protein structure, was born, and it helped Hassabis gain the Nobel Prize.  --></p>
